#### Assets
- icons were taken on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

#### Short Summary
<dd>This is a sample company logo using SVG type image. I used the icons 'cloud' and 'bolt' from font awesome and combined it to make the SVG image. I've placed a button below the SVG for the colors to take effect. The button when toggled, the cloud will turn to gray color from black color. Some of the thunder will turn blue and some will turn dark orange from the original color of black. The color of the text, cloud, and thunder can also change color when the screen size is reduced to 500px width with the use of media query.</dd>
